You will be creating a complete HTML presentation with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality based on a provided training plan. The presentation should be optimized for recording, with minimal text and maximum visual impact.

Your task is to create a single HTML file that contains a complete slide presentation based on the plan outline provided.

Follow these requirements carefully:

Content Requirements:
Skip any audience, prerequisites, delivery methods and assessment sections from the training plan - start with the main content
Each slide should contain minimal text - focus on key numbers, statistics, or single important phrases
Prioritize visual elements: diagrams, charts, icons, illustrations, or large impactful numbers
Extract the main chapters/sections from the plan to create a logical flow of slides
Each major point should get its own slide rather than cramming multiple points together
Visual Design Requirements:
Use high contrast color schemes (dark background with light text)
Large, readable fonts for any text that appears
Clean, minimal design with plenty of white space
Visual hierarchy should guide the viewer's attention to what matters most
Use CSS to create simple diagrams, charts, or visual representations where appropriate
Technical Requirements:
Create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
Implement keyboard navigation: left/right arrow keys to navigate between slides
Display current slide number and total slides in the top right corner (e.g., "3/12")
Show a chapter navigation menu on the left side of the screen listing all major sections
Highlight the current chapter in the navigation menu
Ensure smooth transitions between slides
Make the presentation fullscreen-friendly for recording
Navigation Structure:
The left sidebar should show chapter names extracted from the video notes
Clicking on a chapter should jump to that section
The current chapter should be visually highlighted
Slides should be grouped logically under their respective chapters
Before creating the HTML file, use the scratchpad below to plan your approach:

Plan out: 1. What are the main chapters/sections from the training plan? 2. What key visual elements can you create for each major point? 3. How will you structure the slide progression? 4. What specific numbers, statistics, or key phrases should be highlighted?
Your final output should be a complete, functional HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. The file should be ready to open in a browser for  presentation during a meeting. Make sure the presentation flows logically and each slide serves a clear purpose in supporting the training topic.
